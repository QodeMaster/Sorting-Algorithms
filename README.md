# Sorting-Algorithms

This repository holds the code for the Sorting Alogrithms website that gives you the option to visualize BubbleSort, MergeSort, QuickSort, HeapSort and RadixSort(using buckets). You can select between tow themes: the standard theme with blue staples or the rainbow theme.

## Quick Guide
This websites visually displays the five sorting algortihms listed beneath the header below.
A guest can generate a new unsorted array by pressing the "Generate New Array"-button. It will generate a roster of unsorted staples which will be the subjects of a selected algorithm. The highlighted name of the sorting algorithm means that it's currently selected.

### Size/Speed
The size of the unsorted array and the speed of sorting can be altered by moving each slider respectively.
